# Mangan Tako PHP Website Project

This is the **updated PHP version** of the Mangan Tako website, developed as a school project.  
The website allows users to **browse recipes** and includes **PHP `include` statements** to keep the code organized and reduce repetition.

> Note: This project is **still static** in terms of functionality — the “Add” and “Delete” buttons are placeholders and **do not interact with a database**.

## Project Features
- Browse through different recipe pages  
- Navigation between pages  
- Reusable components using **PHP include statements** (header, footer, etc.)  
- Responsive layout using **Bootstrap 5**  
- Placeholder buttons for adding/deleting recipes (non-functional)

## How to Run Locally
Since this project uses PHP, you need a local server environment like **XAMPP**:

1. Download this repository.  
2. Move the project folder to your XAMPP `htdocs` directory.  
3. Start **Apache** in the XAMPP Control Panel.  
4. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost/your_project_folder/
5. The website should now run locally with the PHP includes working.

> No database is required — all content is static.
